# Praesentation-Spring

This is a simple presentation made for a course of faculty media of the bauhaus-university weimar.
It tries to give a basic understanding why Spring Boot might be a good solution for a microservice architecture.

In the tutorial a basic todo-website was implemented using two microservices.
